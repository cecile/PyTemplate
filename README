The script will copy the folder structure and files into
 the output directory.

Configuration is a JSON file, by default PyTemplate.json

You could change JSON as input parameter:

 $ python PyTemplate.py file.json

All paths are relative to the JSON file location

Folders and files could have __var__ in the names

The files could use template variables as {{var}}
 templates could use Handlebars.js like syntax
 more details in: https://github.com/wbond/pybars3

There is a couple of helpers:
 {{lower var}} for lowercase variable content
 {{upper var}} for uppercase variable content

This could be use in the file names and paths:
 __lower var__
 __upper var__
